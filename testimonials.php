              I can highly recommend DC Physiotherapy in Clondalkin Village. I
              experienced lower back pain over the last 3-4 months as a result of
              working from home and it was starting to take its toll. I heard
              about DC Physiotherapy from friends and I am delighted I made an
              appointment to see David as within 5 mins, he was able to provide a
              root cause for the pain. Three sessions later and I am back running
              pain free. Thanks David for your guidance and genuine interest in my
              well being.

              I have had a painful herniated disc in my neck for over 12 years
              .The pain travelled throughout my shoulders arms and hands.I
              experienced sleepless night's from time to time.When I heard about
              IDD therapy I decided to give it a try. After a few visit's I found
              a good improvement and was soon painfree.The improvement continued
              throughout my treatment.I am now free from pain and painkillers. I
              would definitely recommend anybody with physical issues to go for
              IDD therapy. I am glad I did and its safe and painless.James.

              About two years ago I injured my lower back which caused restricted
              movement and a lot of sciatica pain in my left leg. I tried ignoring
              it, hoping it would get better over time. surprisingly it didn't. I
              went for a scan and the the consultant said my only option was an
              operation to remove the section of herniated disc that was applying
              pressure onto the sciatica nerve. To be honest the taught of an
              operation scared me. So I decided to try alternative treatment
              first. I tried Physiotherapy, with no success. Then I tried amatsu
              treatment, still no success.
