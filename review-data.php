I was first sceptical as I went to few other physios and they did not work for me (one even made me worst). I had 8 sessions so far and being pain free. Do not need pain killers anymore and I am back to normal. I regret onlly 1 thing - I did not meet Dave earlier.

  "{\"id\":\"52\",\"submitted\":\"2022/04/25\",\"author\":\"Julie O Keeffe\",\"rating\":\"★★★★★ (5)\",\"text\":\"I started in DC physiotherapy 2 months ago, when I started I was in absolute agony with two bulging discs in my lower back. I had been in hospital with the pain and I had been put on a lot of strong medication to alleviate the pain (Oxycodone, Co Codemol, Tramadol, Valium and Diclac). I could honestly barely walk the first day I went to DC physiotherapy and I was feeling extremely down in myself as It was so debilitating. I am 38 and have three young children and it was extremely hard to be taking all the tablets and to feel so immobile. From the first day I started my disc compression therapy with Cein I felt better and very confident I would be so much better after ten sessions. I travelled from Waterford twice a week to the sessions and I cannot thank Cein and the lads in DC physiotherapy enough as I am now completely pain free and I have not taken any pain medication in over two weeks (which is massive for me as I had been on tablets for nearly three years). Cein was extremely professional and I felt I could ask him anything about my treatment and he had the answer for me. He is very passionate about his job and he genuinely cares for the client and wants to do everything he can to help them get better. I had my last session today (10 sessions) and I can't thank this clinic enough for making me so much better overall. I had tried everything before this treatment and nothing worked for me. I am so grateful this has worked and it feels amazing to be out of pain. Thank you so much for everything Cein and enjoy the chocs!!
